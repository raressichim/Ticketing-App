Ticketing App
This is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) C++ application that allows users to buy and manage tickets for events. The app incorporates all the OOP principles such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to provide a user-friendly and efficient experience.

OOP Principles
The Ticketing App follows the following OOP principles:

Abstraction: The app hides unnecessary details from users and only presents relevant information such as event names, ticket prices, and purchase history.

Encapsulation: The app groups related data and functions into classes such as User, Event, and Ticket, and protects them from outside interference.

Inheritance: The app uses inheritance to create specialized classes such as Administrator and RegularUser, which inherit from the User class and have additional functionalities.

Polymorphism: The app uses polymorphism to allow different classes such as Event and Ticket to implement the same interface methods such as displayDetails() and calculateRefund() in their own unique ways.
